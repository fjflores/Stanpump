STANPUMP is available, at no charge, to interested investigators and
anesthesiologists. You may share the STANPUMP software with any
interested persons. My only request is that any manuscripts based upon
work with STANPUMP acknowledge, either in the Methods or following the
Discussion, the source of STANPUMP with a statement to the effect that
STANPUMP is freely available from the author at:
